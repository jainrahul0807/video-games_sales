# Video Games Sales Prediction

This repository contains a regression model developed to predict global video game sales yearly. The project also includes a deployment part to make predictions accessible through a web application.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model to predict global video game sales based on historical sales data, game genres, platforms, and other relevant features. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing sales records from various countries to capture global sales patterns and trends.

## Model Deployment

The model is deployed as a web application, allowing users to interact with the trained model and make predictions on global video game sales for specific years, game genres, platforms, and more. The web application provides a user-friendly interface to input data and receive global sales predictions instantly.

## How to Use the Web Application

1. run the application server.
2. Access the web application through your browser by entering the provided URL.
3. Input the relevant data, such as game genre, platform, and year, to get global video game sales predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of regression techniques to predict global video game sales. The deployed web application makes it convenient to access the model's predictions and explore potential sales outcomes for various video game scenarios on a global scale.
